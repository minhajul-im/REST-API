export const PRIVACY_POLICY: string = `Nicotine replacement products help relieve some of the withdrawal symptoms people experience when they quit smoking. Three products for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are currently available over-the-counter in the U.S., including two nicotine patches and nicotine gum. Nicotine nasal spray and a nicotine inhaler are available only by prescription. 
A new non-nicotine pill is also available as a smoking cessation option. An aqua filter cigarette holder (available in drug stores) can reduce the tar and irritation to your throat even if you’re not ready to quit completely. 

To be most effective, nicotine replacement products should be used in conjunction with a behavior change program. The goal in using nicotine medications is to stop smoking completely. If you plan to take nicotine medications, begin using them on the day you quit. If you continue to have strong urges to smoke or are struggling to stop smoking completely, ask your health care provider about additional help.`;
